Here in the File, code has been described for two different update rules in the Active Ising Model in one dimension.
Two different update rules are
(i) Parallel Update (Synchronous)
(ii) Random-sequential Update (Asynchronous)

In a parallel update, All spins are updated in a single instant. That's why it is a Synchronous update. But in Random-sequential,
a spin is randomly selected, then updates its orientation and position, and then comes to the next spin randomly. 
For N particles, a similar process has been done N time, So it is called an Asynchronous update.

The code is attached to the file.
